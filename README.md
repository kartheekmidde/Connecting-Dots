A game similar to Pok√©mon Go with additional customization to create own stops

Parents can create accounts for children and poke stops using google web services. Once the child starts the game and reaches the poke stop, points will be added and the status of the poke stop will be updated. Game ends when all the poke stops are reached by a child and game can be reset by the parent anytime. 

To design the front end of the application HTML/CSS were used. The complete functionality of the application like creation of poke stops, child accounts, user roles etc. were handled using .net framework (MVC). Modernizr was used to detect the HTML5/CSS3 features like geolocation and the position was updated using geolocation features. Data was transferred to other pages using AJAX. JavaScript/jQuery were used for client side scripting.
